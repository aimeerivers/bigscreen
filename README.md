# bigscreen

Want to display images on a big screen?

Simply add to the `images` directory in this repo. Name your images with an incremental number such as `image1.png` and update index.html with the `numberOfImages`.

The images will cycle automatically on [aimeerivers.github.io/bigscreen](https://aimeerivers.github.io/bigscreen)
